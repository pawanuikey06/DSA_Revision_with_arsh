# DSA Revision with Arsh - 30 Days Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the **30 Days DSA Challenge** organized by **ProElevate**. The challenge involves solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems based on questions from **6 prominent companies**. The goal of this challenge is to improve problem-solving skills, enhance understanding of algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Challenge Structure

- The challenge is divided into 30 days, with problems selected from 6 major companies.
- Every day, a new set of problems is provided, and I will be solving them using various data structures and algorithms.

### Companies Covered
The problems in the challenge are designed to mimic the interview-style questions from the following companies:
1. **Amazon**
2. **Microsoft**
3. **Google**
4. **Goldman Sachs**
5. **Atlassian**
6. **Walmart Labs**

## Objectives
- Strengthen my problem-solving abilities in DSA.
- Get better at using fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and hash maps.
- Understand the implementation and application of algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and backtracking.
- Prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies by practicing real interview questions.
